# Spell-It

Knowing how to spell is a fundamental part of being fluent in any language.
Whether you are a youngster learning how to spell or an individual learning a
new language being able to practice helps to solidify your language skills.

The Spell-It app helps users practice their spelling by playing the audio
recording of a word the user must then spell using the computer keyboard.
